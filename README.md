THINGS TO WORK ON
- Visualizations
    - color code the chart like a heatmap
    - charts to compare colleges salaries
- For the major search only show majors for colleges that exist
- For the college search selection, use pagination or some other
technique to let users search for all 6000 colleges
    - right now we do 1000, and that covers 13M/16M students
- Secure the API key using encryption
- Create our own custom "value score" as another column
    - Include a how to of how the value score is calculated
- About us box that users can click and expand
- Bootstrap CSS possibly?
- Potentially get more columns via the data dictionary
